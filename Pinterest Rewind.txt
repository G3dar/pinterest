Pinterest Rewind
Creative Direction & Production Brief
________________


Core Concept
A 45-second cinematic digital experience inspired by Spotify Wrapped, but reimagined for Pinterest  the platform of imagination and creativity.
Pinterest Rewind doesn’t showcase what you consumed; it unveils what inspired you, what you dreamed, and what you’re becoming.
It’s not a recap  it’s a reflection. A self-portrait of your creative energy through the year.


________________


Look & Feel
Overall Aesthetic
* Mood: dreamlike, elegant, emotionally resonant  reminiscent of Sayonara Tarot’s ethereal tone.

* Color Palette: soft gradients, creamy whites, pale golds, and pastel hues that evolve depending on the user’s visual identity.

* Lighting: diffused, nostalgic light  as if seen through morning fog or golden dusk.

* Textures: paper grain, subtle film bloom, and faint dust particles, giving a handcrafted, tangible quality to the motion design.

* Composition: balanced minimalism  wide breathing space with layered visual depth. Focus on motion and emotion rather than data density.

Typography
   * Serif type with a touch of romance (e.g., Canela, Rebond Grotesque, or Editorial New).

   * Minimal use of text phrases appear like whispered insights rather than analytics.

   * Lowercase, and brief phrases like:

      * “you imagined new worlds.”

      * “you followed color where it led.”

      * “you grew softer, bolder, freer.”

Animation Style
         * Slow, fluid transitions  everything feels alive and organic.

         * Morphing forms: boards transforming into constellations, pins blooming like petals, color palettes melting into one another.

         * Camera movement: gentle glides, slow zooms, weightless floating.

         * Motion metaphors: portals, spirals, waves, constellations  symbolizing reflection, growth, and transformation.

Sound Design & Music
            * Original AI-generated ambient score, customized to match the user’s visual profile.

            * Each Rewind has its own “sound world”: dreamy piano, organic textures, choral hums, or vaporous synths.

            * The audio breathes  evolving alongside the visual tone of the user’s year.

________________


Tone of Voice
Softly reflective, emotionally intelligent, and artful.
Not analytical or “data-driven,” but evocative  more like a digital memory than a report.
Each phrase feels like it could belong in a modern poem or aesthetic journal.
“Pinterest Rewind isn’t what you did. It’s what you dreamed.”
 “Your imagination, your colors, your year  revealed.”

Pinterest Rewind
Core Concept: "Your Year of Inspiration"
An interactive annual experience inspired by Spotify Wrapped, but adapted to Pinterest's DNA: introspective, aesthetic, emotional, and above allcreative.
Rather than showing what you consumed, Pinterest Rewind reveals what you dreamed, searched for, imagined, and created throughout the year.
________________


💡 The Big Idea
Pinterest isn't about consumptionit's about projection. Every search, saved pin, and board created is a manifestation of your inner world: your goals, your obsessions, your transformations.
The central concept:
"Pinterest Rewind: A visual journey reflecting who you were this year and who you're becoming."
The project combines:
                        * Emotional + Visual Data (colors, categories, themes, search rhythms)
                        * Personalized Design (dynamic palettes, layouts, subtle mystical touches)
                        * Music & Motion (AI-generated ambient soundtracks matching your aesthetic)
                        * A Poetic Closure: A visual letter or "emotional portrait" of your year, with phrases generated from your interests and searches
